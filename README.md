# Galaxy Simulation

This project is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of a galaxy simulation using Three.js and React. Users can interactively modify the shape and movement of the galaxy by adjusting various parameters.

Adding Asteroids:
- Select "Asteroid" from the editor
- Customize name, size, orbit radius, orbit speed, rotation speed, color, irregular shape option, and inclination
- Click the "Add Asteroid" button to add the asteroid to the simulation

Adding Comets:
- Select "Comet" from the editor
- Customize name, size, perihelion, aphelion, orbit speed, rotation speed, color, tail length, tail color, and inclination
- Click the "Add Comet" button to add the comet to the simulation

Managing Added Objects:
- Added asteroids and comets are displayed in the list on the right side of the screen
- Each object can be removed from the simulation using the "Remove" button next to it# Space-Simulation
